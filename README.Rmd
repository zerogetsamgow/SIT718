# SIT718 Real 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SIT718 is to help me track my learning in the Deakin University course SIT718 Real World Analytics.

Each weeks lecture and practical coding exercises are saved in `.qmd` file in the `R` folder. These files render as `reveal.js` slides.
